# Registart Survey Web App

# Overview
A simple and brief survey developed with the Flask Microframework for Registart, a nonprofit startup that allows high school seniors to encourage their peers to register to vote.

# Functionality
Students can take the survey by inputting their information regarding their relationships with their peers in their NNHS activities and the senior class and obtain a list of 20 students that they should encourage to register to vote.

# How it Works
By taking this survey, sudent organizers will be able the know exactly what Registart is, the Illinois Voter Registration Process, and a guide on how to encourage their peers to vote. Students will enter their activities and their relationships to their senior class peers and obtain a list of 20 student targets.
